## 素材积累

### Part 1

#### Advertisements

**Do you like advertisements?**

Has anyone answered “Yes” to this question? Haha. Most advertisements are boring and intrusive. For example, ads often pop up while I’m watching a YouTube video, and I always get very annoyed. But there’s nothing I can do about it.

```
intrusive 侵扰的
ad = advert = advertisement 广告
pop up 突然出现、蹦出来
annoyed 感到很烦的
```

**What kind of advertising do you like?**

It’s hard to think of any that appeals to me. Creative ones? Interesting ones? I can’t think of any examples, but there could have been some adverts that were fun to watch ... or billboards with funny pictures. But like I said, no specific example comes to mind.

```
think of sth 想到... 
appeal to sb 吸引某人、令某人喜欢
creative 有创意的
there could have been ... 对过去的虚拟
fun 有意思的
billboard （路边的）广告牌
specific 具体的
come to mind 被我想到
```

**Is there an advertisement that made an impression on you when you were a child?**

Made an impression on me ... Yeah, one commercial that I used to see time and time again on TV was ... “羊羊羊” It’s just one sound repeated over and over. This one definitely made a very lasting impression on me. But you know what the problem is? I still don’t know what it advertises.

```
commercial 电视上面的商业广告
time and time again = over and over (again) 一遍又一遍地
lasting 持久的
advertise sth 为...做广告、宣传...
```

**Do you see a lot of advertising on trains or other forms of transport？**

Yeah, I do. And there’s more and more of it. Advertising is everywhere, and that’s why I said it’s very intrusive.

#### Cakes

**Do you have a sweet tooth, enjoying cakes and other treats?**

I believe most people have a sweet tooth. I think it’s in our genes. We naturally feel happy when eating something sweet because of the dopamine rush. But I’m aware that it’s not a healthy habit to eat a lot of sugary things, so I try my best not to.

```
genes 基因
naturally 自然地
dopamine rush 多巴胺激增
aware 有意识的、了解的
sugary 含糖的
try my best 尽我所能
```

**Are there any traditional Chinese cakes that you like?**

Yeah, definitely. Off the top of my head, I can think of mooncakes, which are enjoyed on the Mid-Autumn Festival. But there are tons of other kinds. None of the names is coming to mind now. Um, one kind I like is round, crispy on the outside, and it doesn’t have any filling. What’s it called again? I can’t remember, sorry.

```
off the top of my head 我的第一反应是、我立刻想到的是
think of sth 想到... 
Mid-Autumn Festival 中秋节
tons of ... 很多... 
come to mind 被我想到
crispy 脆的
filling 馅儿
again 来着
```

**Did you like eating cakes as a child?**

I absolutely did. But I don’t remember eating a lot when I was a child. I did have cavities in my teeth, so that should be proof that I always ate stuff that was high in sugar.

```
cavity 蛀牙洞
proof 证据、证明
high in sugar 含糖量高
```

**Can you make cakes?**

No, unfortunately, I can’t. In fact, I can’t make anything. I even need help with cooking some ramen noodles.

```
unfortunately 遗憾的是
ramen noodles = instant noodles 方便面
```

### Part 2

#### 2-1

**Describe a difficult task that you completed at work/study that you felt proud of.**

**You should say :**

- **what the task was;**
- **how you completed it;**
- **why the task was difficult;**
- **and explain why you were proud of completing the task.**

I’m going to describe a task of reading a book and giving a presentation about that book. The book is titled *the* *Seven Habits of Highly Effective People*, which talks about some important habits that we can incorporate into our lives in order to work better, have better relationships and live better lives overall. For example, one of the habits is “Seek first to understand, then to be understood”. It means that while we have a conversation with someone, we should spend more time listening to them, trying to understand their point of view, and then it’ll be more effective to offer our own ideas or opinions. 

This task was very difficult because I only had one week to complete it. I only had one hour to read every night because at the time, I was also busy with some other projects and exams to prepare for. Plus, a presentation was required. I had to summarize the main points, think about what examples to talk about, work on the slides, and then practice giving the presentation. It was pretty challenging. 

I felt very proud of completing this task because after the presentation in class, I got a big round of applause from my classmates and econ teacher. They said that they particularly liked the examples I used. 

```
be titled ... 标题是... 
incorporate sth into sth 将...纳入/融入... 
in order to do sth 为了
... overall 总体上
point of view 观点
effective 有效的
at the time 在那段时间
project 项目
prepare for an exam 准备考试（注意这里要有 for）
plus 另外
summarize the main points 总结主要内容
slides 幻灯片
challenging 有挑战性的
a big round of applause 热烈的掌声
econ = economics 经济学
particularly 尤其、特别
```

#### 2-2

**Describe a drawing or painting you like.**

**You should say :**

- **when you first saw this drawing or painting;**
- **who painted it;**
- **what the painting is about;**
- **and explain why you like this drawing or painting.**

Well, I’m not very interested in art, so I don’t know much about works of art, and it’s pretty difficult to talk about those classic works. I thought long and hard and just decided to describe a drawing that my niece did.

It was a few months ago that I saw it. If I remember correctly, it was a Saturday morning and I was asked to go and babysit my 4-year-old niece because her parents had to run some errands and couldn’t take her with them. I went, spent some time with her and she showed this drawing.

Like I said, my niece is 4 years old and she goes to preschool now. At school, she does all kinds of activities, including building with blocks, playing on slides and seesaws, coloring and drawing.

And this piece of art that she created was about her mom eating noodles, haha. In the picture, there’s a circle with many lines in it, and that is a bowl of noodles. There’s also something that looks like a jellyfish, but she told me it was her mom.

I really liked that drawing just because ... although it’s not very lifelike, it’s pretty cute, especially because her mom looks like a jellyfish, that’s really funny, haha.

```
work of art 艺术作品 
work 作品
classic 经典的
niece 侄女、外甥女
if I remember correctly 如果我没记错的话
babysit 代人临时照看小孩
run some errands 出去办一些事
preschool 幼儿园
blocks 积木
slide 滑梯 
seesaw 跷跷板
color v. 涂色
jellyfish 水母
lifelike 逼真的
```

## 背诵 99 句

> 注意：99 句练习的目的是帮助大家提升语感、词汇、句型、发音、逻辑等，并非是在考场上必须原句使用。在考试中，
> 如果某个词、句型、句子自然脱口而出，很好。但是，不要逼迫自己必须说某个背过的句子。有时，在不合适的地方说
> 出某个句子，反倒会导致整体回答很奇怪。

### 时间

I used to eat chocolate <u>**every single day**</u> as a kid, whereas now, I only eat it <u>**occasionally/from time to time/once in a while**</u>. 

It’s okay to stay up <u>**occasionally/from time to time/once in a while**</u>, but if you do it <u>**on a daily basis**</u>, it can be extremely harmful to your health. 

We have tons of homework <u>**pretty much every day**</u>, which really drives me crazy. 

One thing I like about my hometown is that there are many parks here. I go to the park near my home <u>**pretty often/on a pretty regular basis**</u>. 

One healthy habit of mine is going to the gym <u>**regularly**</u>. 

There used to be a petting zoo close to my apartment and I would visit it <u>**two or three times a month**</u>. 

I don't eat ice cream <u>**that often/frequently**</u> now, whereas when I was a kid, it was a daily treat for me. 

I <u>**seldom**</u> have to fix things because my dad is the handyman in our household. I don't have to do any repair work.

### 地点

Whenever I need to concentrate on some important work, I go to a cafe <u>**close to**</u> my home.

There’s a lake <u>**within walking distance of**</u> my house and I really enjoy taking a walk around it.

My best friend's house is just <u>**a short walk away from**</u> my house, so we often hang out together, either at her place or mine.

Tibet is <u>**very far from**</u> my hometown, and visiting this amazing and majestic place has always been a dream of mine.

The heavy rain caused the traffic to come to a standstill that day, so <u>**it took me over 2 hours to**</u> get to my office.

The nearest library is about 3 kilometers away, and <u>**it takes me about 15 minutes to**</u> bike there.

```
close to sth 离...很近

### 人物

<u>**My folks**</u> came to visit me, and it has made me really happy. 

Some of <u>**my closest friends**</u> are multilingual, and I really envy them for their language skills. 

<u>**A good friend of mine**</u> told me that the key to living a healthy life is striking a work-life balance. 

<u>**One of my neighbors/relatives**</u> has started her own tutoring business and asked if I would like to partner with her. I'm still considering it. 

I was always an introverted kid and preferred to be <u>**alone/on my own**</u> most of the time. Art helped me express my feelings and emotions.

```

the key to sth ...的关键
strike a work-life balance 达到工作生活平衡

### 感受

One of my favorite things to do in my downtime is to watch movies, which is <u>**a great way to relax/unwind**</u>.

The weekend is an important time of the week because it’s when we can <u>**de-stress/recharge**</u>.

I make it a point to listen to some soothing R&B every night. <u>**It helps me clear my mind**</u> and get ready for bed.

My favorite hangout is my little balcony garden. Tending to my plants <u>**provides a good escape from the daily routine**</u>.

I still remember vividly what it was like in middle school. Every day was <u>**an enjoyable/a pleasurable**</u> experience.

Just one small bite of chocolate can <u>**put people in a better mood**</u>. I think it’s due to the release of dopamine in our brains.

I was <u>**on cloud nine/overjoyed/extremely happy**</u> when my boyfriend gave me a necklace as a birthday gift. It was like a piece of art.

Our party lasted until 3 am, and we all <u>**had a great time/had a lot of fun/had a blast**</u>.

Each time I go traveling with my friends, it’s <u>**a great bonding experience**</u>. <u>**It helps bring us closer together**</u>.

I don’t get a lot of days off, but when I do, I like to <u>**spend some quality time**</u> with my parents.

I guess I was late for the meeting just because I didn’t want to be there on time. I was sure it was going to be <u>**incredibly dull/boring**</u>.

It was a good coffeemaker, but the process of making a cup of coffee was really <u>**time-consuming**</u>.

Learning English already <u>**takes up a lot of my time**</u> now, so I don’t suppose I’ll delve into another language anytime soon.

I used to think taking a nap was <u>**a waste of time**</u>, but now I know that just a 15-minute nap can work wonders.

Bags are just <u>**not my thing**</u>. I have a backpack, and I think it’s more than enough.
