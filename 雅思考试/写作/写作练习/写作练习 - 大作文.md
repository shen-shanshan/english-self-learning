### 老龄化

#### 题目

In many countries, the proportion of older people is steadily increasing. Does this trend have positive or negative effects on society ?

#### 观点

观点（好处）：
A.老年人的比例增加，年轻人的就业压力减小。
B.因为，老年人的比例增加，年轻人的人口数减少，就业竞争缓和，对于刚毕业的大学生来说，更容易找到满意的工作。
C.举例，随着越来越多的老人退休，会有更多的岗位空缺出来提供给年轻人，并且竞争同一个岗位的年轻人的人数也更少，因此企业招聘的要求会降低，年轻人更容易找到好工作。

观点（坏处）：
A.老年人的比例增加，社会的医疗资源会更紧缺。
B.因为相比于年轻人，老年人的身体更加脆弱，容易患上各种疾病，which 会导致大量的医疗开销。
C.举例，老年人的骨头比较疏松，当发生摔跤等情况时，很容易骨折，并且对于普通疾病如感冒等的抵抗力也更低。另外，老年人容易得一些老年群体才会得的病，如阿兹海默症、帕金森症等。

#### 正文

Nowadays, an dramatic increase in the proportion of the older generation can be seen in some counrties. Although this trend can offer more opportunities to the young people after finishing education, I believe that an aging population can have more negative effect on society.

On the one hand, the fierce competition between young people when they search for a job can be alleviate as the number of elder people has been increasing. Since the proportion of older people increase, the number of young students applying the same position is more likely to reduce.
For example, a large number of  opportunities tend to be released as more and more older people are approved for their retirement. In addition, the requirement for job and the salaries offered by some companies can be more friendly to the young people.

On the other hand, there can be a lack of medicine resources with the coming of an aging population. Because the body of older people are more vulnerable comparing with who are younger, and there can be a greater need for medical care. For instance, some older people are more likely to get the brittle-bone disease, which can make themselves get injured more easily after tumbling. And some diseases happening more on older people such as Alzheimer and Parkinson can impose a burden on the medical costs of the government.

In conclusion, I believe that this trend of an aging population can have more negative effect on the government and society, although it can benefit the young people when they need to find a job.

### 进口产品

#### 题目

In some countries, it is now possible for people to buy products made in other countries. To what extent do the benefits of this development outweigh the problem ?

#### 观点

观点（好处）：
A.人们可以买进口产品。
B.提高生活质量。
C.中国人可以体验到更多种类的美食，such as 汉堡、薯条等；中国人可以使用到质量更好的商品，such as 欧莱雅等护肤品，which 比中国的大宝等产品护肤效果更好。

观点（坏处）：
A.人们可以买进口产品。
B.外来的商品会对本土商品的销售造成影响。
C.随着人们经济水平的提高，对产品的安全和效果更加关注，而不是价格，人们会更愿意买一些进口产品，因此本国企业的经济效益会受到影响，有不少人甚至可能会失业。

#### 正文

There has been a trend of economic globalization all around the world, which may result in that people can buy products made by other countries. Although the profit of native companies may be influenced, I believe that it can have many advantages for native people.

On the one hand, native people are more likely to buy some products of good quality made in other countries rather than the goods made by companies in their own country, which may pose a threat to native companies. Because better effects and a higher level of security are what people pursue nowadays instead of the price of products, as the wealth of people in some countries have been increasing dramatically in past decades. For example, some cosmetics such as OREAL are more popular within chinese people, and the sale of goods like DaBao can be influenced.

On the other hand, people can experience more categories of products and have a more colorful life. Because this trend is likely to provide more choice when people buy things, and people can choose the products which they like best. For example, some people tend to eat hanburgers and chips which can satisfy their taste, and some dedicating themselves to photography can use camera made in Japan, such as Nikon and Canon.

In conclusion, I believe this trend of buying products from other countries can have a positive effect on the social life of people, though a number of native products can be influenced.

### 立法

#### 题目

The efficient functioning of society is based on rules and laws. Society would not function well if individuals were free to do whatever they wanted. To what extent do you agree or disagree ?

#### 观点

B.因为如果人们的受教育程度都很高，都有良好的道德素养，那么在某些事情上即使没有立法，人们也会遵守。
C.举例，现在人们的环保意识越来越强，即使没有法律的约束，人们也知道要节约粮食，比如光盘行动，这有利于提高社会资源的利用率。

#### 正文

Today, there are legislations in many countries so that people in these nations are more likely to live a peaceful lives. In my opinion, society can not have a high level of efficiency if people were liberal to do things casualy.

On the one hand, citizens can live in a efficient society if they are free to do anything they like, as long as they are highly educated and have a high level of morality. This is because residents who are kind and knowledgeable tend to know what they can do and what can not. In this sense, our society can be peaceable and well-ordered, even if there are less laws that can restrict people's behaviours. For example, citizens may not hurt others even though they do not need to assume the legal responsibility. And they are more likely to make some efforts to save foods and protect the environment without compulsion. Therefore, our society can function well when people have a freedom to do anything.

On the other hand, our society will not run efficiently if residents are free to do anything they want, as there are some people who are selfish and violent in many naitons. Because these dangerous people tend to do some bad things due to their greed, and some companies are more likely to earn illegal peofits, if there are not rules to punish them. For instance, people who have killed others should be sent into the prison and may be killed by guns of the policeman in China. And companies impairing rights of consumers can be fined by the government. Thus, it is necessary to control individuals' behavious so that our society can function more efficiently.

In conclusion, I agree that legislation which can regulate people's freedom to do anything they want is necessary to the efficient functioning of society, although it may not be needed in some part of the world in which individuals have a good education and morality.

### 看电视

#### 题目

Some people believe that children can learn effectively by watching TV and should be encouraged to watch TV both at home and at school. To what extend do you agree or disagree ?

#### 观点

观点（支持）：
A.看电视。
B.提高学习兴趣，感受直观，印象深刻。
C.学习更加高效。

观点（反对）：

C.不能提高学习效果。

#### 正文

Recently, there has been a dramatic change in the ways of learning over the past few decades, as televisions have been becoming more popular in many countries. It is claimed that students can have a high level of efficience in learning through watching TV more frequently. In my opinion, I partly disagree with this for some reasons.

Admittedly, one cannot deny that the learning effect of the younger generation may be improved by watching TV in some respects. As the vedio on the screen is colorful and  interesting, which is more likely to attract kids' attention and may make them love studying. For example, teachers tend to play some vedios on the history or physics lessons to illustrate the knowledges so that students can understand them well and have a better memory on them. Thus, children may be motivated to make greater efforts to study in the courses.

However, the encouragement for watching television in kids' daily lives may result in a low level of abilities in reading and writing, which can lead to the low efficiency in learning. This is because watching TV is some kind of amusement in essence, and does not need some consideration sometimes, and it is also more liky to reduce the time of kids to read books and write essays. For instance, more and more children love to watch cartoons after school in many nations today, which may pose a threat to their grades in school. Furthermore, they may not like to read good books, such as literary classics, and have less opportunities to practice their writing skills.

In conclusion, I disagree with that the young people should watch television more frequently in their daily lives, as it may weaken their reading and writing skills.

### 学校的规则

#### 题目

Some people think that children should obey rules and do what their parents and teachers want them to do. Other people think that children controlled too much cannot deal with problems themselves in adulthood. Discuss both views and state your own opinion.

#### 正文

Today, the concentration of the public on educational problems has been increasing, and some claimed that following regulations at home and school is necessary to develop the children's abilities of solving problems. In my opinion, I disagree with this view, since the younger generation cannot deal with issues well because of too much restrictions imposed on them.

On the one hand, children can acquire knowledges and engage their abilities, which may help them to solve problems when they grow up, if they are forced to do things by school. This is because if the behaviours of students are not controlled, they may tend to play games or have some fun, which can pose a hefty threat to the time for children to learn some useful skills, such as laws and economics. For example, people who have few legal knowledges may perform poorly in solving issues when they have some economic dispute with others. Therefore, there may be some necessities to impose restrictions on what children should do.

On the other hand, the young people may become nonindependent when they have to tackle issues in their daily lives, if there are too much regulations imposed on them. As the children who are always taught to do what their parents or teachers tell them, they may feel confused when they need to deal with problems by themselves. For instance, their time may be fully managed both at home and school, which may result in the ignorance in time planning, so that they are more likely to make a mess when they have to tackle many issues at the same time. In this sense, too much restrictions on children can have a negative effect on their abilities to solve issues in parallel.

In conclusion, less freedom of children to experience their lifetime can be detrimental to their independence when tackle issues, although their knowledge may be largely increased by following what they are required.

#### 正文

Today, educational institutions tend to be the main sources to acquire knowledge for students, and some people deem that only the knowledge of students' majors should be imparted by tutors in these institutions, while opponents argue that the ability to distinguish good from evil should also be developed. In my opinion, I think the learning for specialities and differentiating right and wrong are both indispensable for students in their educational time and may benefit themselves in the future.

On the one hand, some claim that the majors of students should be the only target in their educational lives. Because they can have more time to practice their academic skills and are more likely to concentrate on the learning for knowledge of their specialities. For example, students who spend the most of their time in developing academic abilities tend to have more opportunities to become the experts in their areas and may make more contributions to the development of society.

On the other hand, opponents argue that the abilities to distinguish good from evil are also necessary for students, and educational institutions should be accountable for this. As these abilities can help them to perform better in cooperating with others and can cultivate their morality. For instance, they may tend to show a friendly manner when they talk with peers, and understand the condemnation of illegal behaviours such as murder, which may be favorable to the peace of society.

In conclusion, I believe that not only the knowledge of students' specialities but also the abilities to distinguish good and bad are both necessary for students, and educational institutions should pay more attention to the comprehensive development of them.

### 消费社会

#### 题目

It has been argued that we are living in a throw-away society in which people throw away what they use in daily life, instead of recycling or reusing it. Why has this happend and how can we address this problem ?

#### 观点

原因：
A.国家经济水平提高。
B.人们收入增加，买得起自己喜欢的东西，不需要通过回收来省钱。
C.throw-away society。

解决方案：
A.提高人们的环保意识。
B.人们愿意重复利用生活中的废品，从而节约资源、金钱，保护环境。
C.recycling or reusing。

#### 正文

Recently, there has been a increase in the number of the things threw away by citizens, and few of them tend to make twice use of these things in their trash can. This is because individuals' income has been increasing and they can afford what they like. To avoid this consequence, the government should cultivate the public's awareness of conservation.

There are some reasons behind this situation. The first reason is the wealth of residents has been enhanced over the past few decades and their quality of lives have also been improved. As a result, they are more likely to purchase commodities which they like and are the most advanced and tend to abandon the old things which are old fashion instead of reusing them to save money. The second reason is the lack of consciousness of saving resources and protecting environment. In this sense, people may throw away things as they will and do not understand the negative effects behind this behaviour.

To address these problems, the government should popularize the concept of green development and make members of public be conscious of conservation. As a result, dwellers are more likely to impose restrictions on their desire to consume and utilise things for a longer period. In addition, some methods of recycling should be spread in communities. For example, the approaches to convert used bottles to other useful things such as flower pots and pen containers should be shared within residents, thus they may be more willing to make twice use of what they want to abandon.

In conclusion, individuals tend to acquire goods in fashion instead of continuing the use of the old ones because of the large raise in their earnings. And the government should make greater efforts to tackle the lack of awareness of protecting environment in society.
