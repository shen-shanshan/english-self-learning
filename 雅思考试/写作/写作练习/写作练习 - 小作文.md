Overall, an noticeable increase can be seen in the quantities of products transported by the road, the water and the pipeline, while the quantities of items sent by the rail has remained a stable trend, with two lowest point at around 1985 and 1995. In addition, road is the most popular way to carry things in the UK before 2002, while pipeline is the least-used transportation.

With regards to the road, it is the dominant means of transportation, with around 70 million tonnes of commodities shipped through this way in 1974, rising to around 100 million tonnes in 2002. Meanwhile, the water can be the second popular transportation during the twenty-eight-year period, and the figure for goods posted by this way are between 40 and 60 million tonnes approximately.

By comparison, the pipeline shows the lowest quantities which are no higher than 25 million tonnes until 2002. Moreover, the figure for products transported by rail remained the middle level among these means, fluctuating between 20 and 40 million tonnes.

The line graph illustrates changes in the cost of six different powers used by the USA from 1980 to 2008, and predicts that in the future until 2030.

Overall, a noticeable growth was seen in the spending of petrol/oil, coal, natural gas, nuclear, and solar/wind, and then this trend will continue in the next few years. By contrast, consumption of hydropower fluctuated over the past years before 2008, after which it will remain stable in the future until 2030. Moreover, petrol/oil has been becoming the highest waste of energy throughout the period, while the lowest was hydropower.

With regards to petrol/oil, the cost of it dropped in 1985 and 1995 at approximately 33 quadrillion units twice, and then it has been climbing significantly until 2030 at around 50. Similarly, that of coal has been rising from 1980 at 20 quadrillion units to 2030 at around 30. In addition, that of natural gas increased gradually from 1980 at over 15 quadrillion units to 2013, before remaining virtually unchanged at around 25.

As for nuclear and solar/wind, there were similarly upward trends in the consumption of them, with around 3 quadrillion in 1980 used in the USA, rising at aroung 6 in 2030. By comparison, the cost of hydropower has been remaining stable at approximately 3 quadrillion units throughout the period.
