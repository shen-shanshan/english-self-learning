This line graph illustrate the changes in the figure for commodities carried by four means of transportation in the UK during a period from 1974 to 2002.

Overall, an noticeable increase can be seen in the quantities of products transported by the road, the water and the pipeline, while the quantities of items sent by the rail has remained a stable trend, with two lowest point at around 1985 and 1995. In addition, road is the most popular way to carry things in the UK before 2002, while pipeline is the least-used transportation.

With regards to the road, it is the dominant means of transportation, with around 70 million tonnes of commodities shipped through this way in 1974, rising to around 100 million tonnes in 2002. Meanwhile, the water can be the second popular transportation during the twenty-eight-year period, and the figure for goods posted by this way are between 40 and 60 million tonnes approximately.

By comparison, the pipeline shows the lowest quantities which are no higher than 25 million tonnes until 2002. Moreover, the figure for products transported by rail remained the middle level among these means, fluctuating between 20 and 40 million tonnes.

The line graph illustrates changes in the cost of six different powers used by the USA from 1980 to 2008, and predicts that in the future until 2030.

Overall, a noticeable growth was seen in the spending of petrol/oil, coal, natural gas, nuclear, and solar/wind, and then this trend will continue in the next few years. By contrast, consumption of hydropower fluctuated over the past years before 2008, after which it will remain stable in the future until 2030. Moreover, petrol/oil has been becoming the highest waste of energy throughout the period, while the lowest was hydropower.

With regards to petrol/oil, the cost of it dropped in 1985 and 1995 at approximately 33 quadrillion units twice, and then it has been climbing significantly until 2030 at around 50. Similarly, that of coal has been rising from 1980 at 20 quadrillion units to 2030 at around 30. In addition, that of natural gas increased gradually from 1980 at over 15 quadrillion units to 2013, before remaining virtually unchanged at around 25.

As for nuclear and solar/wind, there were similarly upward trends in the consumption of them, with around 3 quadrillion in 1980 used in the USA, rising at aroung 6 in 2030. By comparison, the cost of hydropower has been remaining stable at approximately 3 quadrillion units throughout the period.

The bar chart compares the proportion of Australian boys majoring in eight categories of specialty with that of Australian girls in 1995.

Overall, the percentage of men who chose to study Engineering, Maths & Sciences, Computing and Accounting & Economics was much higher than that of women, while Arts & Humanities, Health, Education and Business studies were more popular within girls. Moreover, Engineering was boys' favorite subject, whereas that of female students was Arts & Humanities.

With regards to Engineering, the proportion of male learners who studied it was approximately nine times higher than that of females, with around 18% of boys enrolled in it, while the data of girls was dramaticly low at around 2%. In addition, Maths & Sciences were the second popular subjects within the men in school (14%), while the percentage of women learning it (7%) was half of that of men. Similarly, Computing and Accounting & Economics were also more popular within boys than girls.

As for Arts & Humanities, it were the female students' favorite, with around 19% of girls studying them, which was obviously higher than the percentage of boys (13%). Moreover, there was a dramatic gap between the proportion of the men majoring in Health and that of female, and the percentage of female people was (15%) over three times as high as that of male people (4%). Similarly, Education and Business Studies were more popular between girls compared with boys.

The pie chart compares different types of reasons leading to land degradation in the world, and the table presents the information about the proportion of a variety of causes of degradation in three countries in 1990s.

Overall, over-gazing is the most significant reason of land degradation in the earth, and the degree of degradation in the Europe was much higher than that of any other countries in this table.

In the first chart, the percentage of over-gazing is the highest (35%), while that of over-cultivation and deforestation are a little bit lower (28% and 30% respectively). By comparison, the other causes are less important than the formers (7%).

As shown in the second chart, 23% of land degraded in the Europe, which was much higher than that of the North America and the Oceania, 5% and 13%, respectively. In addition, the proportion of deforestation and over-cultivation in the Europe was also the highest (9.8% and 7.7%), while the lowest was 0.2% and 0%, in the North America and The Oceania respectively. In contrast, the highest percentage of over-gazing was in the Oceania (around 11%), which was twice as high as that of the Europe (5.5%).

**1st body paragraph: details for the pie chart**

When it comes to the factors why land was deteriorated, this is mainly because of over-gazing, which accounts for 35%, and this is followed by that for over- cultivation at 28%. Moreover, 30% was due to deforestation, while the lowest is for the proportion for other factors, with 7%.

**2nd body paragraph: details for the table**

In terms of the proportion of land that was degraded in the three regions, it can be seen that Europe was mostly affected by those factors, which accounted for 23% of its total and most of it was due to deforestation with 9.8%. However, the percentage of land that was degraded in Oceania was 13%, which was constituted by 11.3% that was destroyed by over-grazing and 1.7% was by deforestation. What is more, there was no record of over-cultivation existing in Oceania, but it was the main reason for land deterioration in North America, constituting 3.3% of the total land deteriorated(5%).
