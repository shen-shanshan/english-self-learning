### 题目

In many countries, the proportion of older people is steadily increasing. Does this trend have positive or negative effects on society?

### 练习

On the one hand, the social issues related to an aging population can lead to a dramatic increase in medical cost, which may impose more burden on taxpayers. Since a large number of requirements and costs in medicine can happen in the old age. For instance, more money will be paid by the government on taking care of the older generation, which can result in the lack of funds in other essential services, such as education.

Besides, the pace of work will slow down with the increase in the number of senior workers. Because the ability of absorbing information and completing work may decrease as people getting older. And the productivity and profitability of companies can be influenced, for example, if the elderly people prolong their working lives.

On the other hand, the working experience of senior workers can be a valuable asset as many senior workers postpone their retirement. Because people are willing to stay in the workforce as they can live longer lives, they can be the expert in their fields of work. And they can work as consultants, conveying knowledge and skills to the young recruits. For example, some experienced managers will teach young people how to manage a company and service the customers.

In conclusion, a large increase in the life expectancy of population has posed a threat to the health care  in many countries, and can also affect the output of the labors. Therefore, an aging population can have a negative effect on social economics, although we can tap into the wisdom of the senior workers.
