### 老龄化

#### 题目

In many countries, the proportion of older people is steadily increasing. Does this trend have positive or negative effects on society?

#### 观点

观点（好处）：
A.老年人的比例增加，年轻人的就业压力减小。
B.因为，老年人的比例增加，年轻人的人口数减少，就业竞争缓和，对于刚毕业的大学生来说，更容易找到满意的工作。
C.举例，随着越来越多的老人退休，会有更多的岗位空缺出来提供给年轻人，并且竞争同一个岗位的年轻人的人数也更少，因此企业招聘的要求会降低，年轻人更容易找到好工作。

观点（坏处）：
A.老年人的比例增加，社会的医疗资源会更紧缺。
B.因为相比于年轻人，老年人的身体更加脆弱，容易患上各种疾病，which 会导致大量的医疗开销。
C.举例，老年人的骨头比较疏松，当发生摔跤等情况时，很容易骨折，并且对于普通疾病如感冒等的抵抗力也更低。另外，老年人容易得一些老年群体才会得的病，如阿兹海默症、帕金森症等。

#### 正文

Nowadays, an dramatic increase in the proportion of the older generation can be seen in some counrties. Although this trend can offer more opportunities to the young people after finishing education, I believe that an aging population can have more negative effect on society.

On the one hand, the fierce competition between young people when they search for a job can be alleviate as the number of elder people has been increasing. Since the proportion of older people increase, the number of young students applying the same position is more likely to reduce.
For example, a large number of  opportunities tend to be released as more and more older people are approved for their retirement. In addition, the requirement for job and the salaries offered by some companies can be more friendly to the young people.

On the other hand, there can be a lack of medicine resources with the coming of an aging population. Because the body of older people are more vulnerable comparing with who are younger, and there can be a greater need for medical care. For instance, some older people are more likely to get the brittle-bone disease, which can make themselves get injured more easily after tumbling. And some diseases happening more on older people such as Alzheimer and Parkinson can impose a burden on the medical costs of the government.

In conclusion, I believe that this trend of an aging population can have more negative effect on the government and society, although it can benefit the young people when they need to find a job.

### 进口产品

#### 题目

#### 观点

观点（好处）：
A.人们可以买进口产品。
B.提高生活质量。
C.中国人可以体验到更多种类的美食，such as 汉堡、薯条等；中国人可以使用到质量更好的商品，such as 欧莱雅等护肤品，which 比中国的大宝等产品护肤效果更好。

观点（坏处）：

B.外来的商品会对本土商品的销售造成影响。
C.随着人们经济水平的提高，对产品的安全和效果更加关注，而不是价格，人们会更愿意买一些进口产品，因此本国企业的经济效益会受到影响，有不少人甚至可能会失业。

#### 正文

There has been a trend of economic globalization all around the world, which may result in that people can buy products made by other countries. Although the profit of native companies may be influenced, I believe that it can have many advantages for native people.

On the one hand, native people are more likely to buy some products of good quality made in other countries rather than the goods made by companies in their own country, which may pose a threat to native companies. Because better effects and a higher level of security are what people pursue nowadays instead of the price of products, as the wealth of people in some countries have been increasing dramatically in past decades. For example, some cosmetics such as OREAL are more popular within chinese people, and the sale of goods like DaBao can be influenced.

On the other hand, people can experience more categories of products and have a more colorful life. Because this trend is likely to provide more choice when people buy things, and people can choose the products which they like best. For example, some people tend to eat hanburgers and chips which can satisfy their taste, and some dedicating themselves to photography can use camera made in Japan, such as Nikon and Canon.

In conclusion, I believe this trend of buying products from other countries can have a positive effect on the social life of people, though a number of native products can be influenced.

### 立法

#### 题目

The efficient functioning of society is based on rules and laws. Society would not function well if individuals were free to do whatever they wanted. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

#### 观点

观点（支持）：
A.法律能够约束人们的行为，保证社会的稳定，提高生产效率。
B.因为法律会惩罚罪犯，可以震慑想要犯罪的人。法律也可以约束企业的行为，确保国家经济的稳定，促进科技的发展。
C.举例，重罪如杀人，会判无期徒刑，轻罪如抢劫打人，会记入个人档案，影响个人的就业，因此人们会约束自己的行为，避免犯罪，这有利于人们安居乐业。

观点（反对）：
A.如果人们的道德很高，即使不受到法律的约束，社会也能高效运行。
B.因为如果人们的受教育程度都很高，都有良好的道德素养，那么在某些事情上即使没有立法，人们也会遵守。
C.举例，现在人们的环保意识越来越强，即使没有法律的约束，人们也知道要节约粮食，比如光盘行动，这有利于提高社会资源的利用率。

#### 正文

Today, there are legislations in many countries so that people in these nations are more likely to live a peaceful lives. In my opinion, society can not have a high level of efficiency if people were liberal to do things casualy.

On the one hand, citizens can live in a efficient society if they are free to do anything they like, as long as they are highly educated and have a high level of morality. This is because residents who are kind and knowledgeable tend to know what they can do and what can not. In this sense, our society can be peaceable and well-ordered, even if there are less laws that can restrict people's behaviours. For example, citizens may not hurt others even though they do not need to assume the legal responsibility. And they are more likely to make some efforts to save foods and protect the environment without compulsion. Therefore, our society can function well when people have a freedom to do anything.

On the other hand, our society will not run efficiently if residents are free to do anything they want, as there are some people who are selfish and violent in many naitons. Because these dangerous people tend to do some bad things due to their greed, and some companies are more likely to earn illegal peofits, if there are not rules to punish them. For instance, people who have killed others should be sent into the prison and may be killed by guns of the policeman in China. And companies impairing rights of consumers can be fined by the government. Thus, it is necessary to control individuals' behavious so that our society can function more efficiently.

In conclusion, I agree that legislation which can regulate people's freedom to do anything they want is necessary to the efficient functioning of society, although it may not be needed in some part of the world in which individuals have a good education and morality.
