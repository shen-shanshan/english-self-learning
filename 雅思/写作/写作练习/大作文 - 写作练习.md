### 观点

观点（好处）：

B.因为，老年人的比例增加，年轻人的人口数减少，就业竞争缓和，对于刚毕业的大学生来说，更容易找到满意的工作。
C.举例，随着越来越多的老人退休，会有更多的岗位空缺出来提供给年轻人，并且竞争同一个岗位的年轻人的人数也更少，因此企业招聘的要求会降低，年轻人更容易找到好工作。

观点（坏处）：

B.因为相比于年轻人，老年人的身体更加脆弱，容易患上各种疾病，which 会导致大量的医疗开销。

### 正文

Nowadays, an dramatic increase in the proportion of the older generation can be seen in some counrties. Although this trend can offer more opportunities to the young people after finishing education, I believe that an aging population can have more negative effect on society.

On the one hand, the fierce competition between young people when they search for a job can be alleviate as the number of elder people has been increasing. Since the proportion of older people increase, the number of young students applying the same position is more likely to reduce.
For example, a large number of  opportunities tend to be released as more and more older people are approved for their retirement. In addition, the requirement for job and the salaries offered by some companies can be more friendly to the young people.

On the other hand, there can be a lack of medicine resources with the coming of an aging population. Because the body of older people are more vulnerable comparing with who are younger, and there can be a greater need for medical care. For instance, some older people are more likely to get the brittle-bone disease, which can make themselves get injured more easily after tumbling. And some diseases happening more on older people such as Alzheimer and Parkinson can impose a burden on the medical costs of the government.

In conclusion, I believe that this trend of an aging population can have more negative effect on the government and society, although it can benefit the young people when they need to find a job.

### 正文

There has been a trend of economic globalization all around the world, which may result in that people can buy products made by other countries. Although the profit of native companies may be influenced, I believe that it can have many advantages for native people.

On the one hand, native people are more likely to buy some products of good quality made in other countries rather than the goods made by companies in their own country, which may pose a threat to native companies. Because better effects and a higher level of security are what people pursue nowadays instead of the price of products, as the wealth of people in some countries have been increasing dramatically in past decades. For example, some cosmetics such as OREAL are more popular within chinese people, and the sale of goods like DaBao can be influenced.

On the other hand, people can experience more categories of products and have a more colorful life. Because this trend is likely to provide more choice when people buy things, and people can choose the products which they like best. For example, some people tend to eat hanburgers and chips which can satisfy their taste, and some dedicating themselves to photography can use camera made in Japan, such as Nikon and Canon.

In conclusion, I believe this trend of buying products from other countries can have a positive effect on the social life of people, though a number of native products can be influenced.
